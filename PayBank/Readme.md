## Architecture

We use **VIPER** - like approach for creating modules. VIPER is an application of Clean Architecture to iOS apps.  Clean Architecture divides an appâ€™s logical structure into distinct layers of responsibility. 

The main parts of VIPER are:
**View**: displays what it is told to by the Presenter and relays user input back to the Presenter.
**Interactor** : contains the business logic as specified by a use case.
**Presenter**: contains view logic for preparing content for display (as received from the Interactor) and for reacting to user inputs (by requesting new data from the Interactor).
**Entity**: contains basic model objects used by the Interactor.
**Routing**: contains navigation logic for describing which screens are shown in which order.

To create a new VIPER-module use
```shell
generamba gen <Name> swifty_viper --module_path '/Module_Path'
```

We use pattern to manage app flows. The Coordinator is main responsibility is to handle all the logic for presentation between View Controllers. More detail you could find [here](https://medium.com/blacklane-engineering/coordinators-essential-tutorial-part-i-376c836e9ba7)

We use [Swinject](https://github.com/Swinject) to manage DI.

## Code Style

Please, take a look at our [code style](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide). 

[SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) helps us to keep code neat and tidy, so be sure to do your best to minimize amount of warnings from it.


## Notes

We  use logging (for API) only in debug mode to prevent theft of important data.
